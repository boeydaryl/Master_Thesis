  FASTQC for assessing raw FASTQ files.
  salmon for transcript abundance quantification.
  tximport for producing estimated counts as input to DESeq2.
  DESeq 2 for DE analysis.
  Biomart for gene annotation and producing geneLevelStats.
  Ensembldb for gene annotation.
  EnhancedVolcano for volcano plots.
  GeneVenn for overlapping genes and analysis.
  Piano for Gene Set Analysis.
